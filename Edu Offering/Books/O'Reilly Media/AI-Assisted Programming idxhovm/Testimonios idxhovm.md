We have dev teams building on measuring estimating and CRM software for construction especially flooring and countertop trades for 20 years on various tech stacks, Windows desktop, iOS/Android apps, and browser-based project management. As a Ph.D from computer science, I never thought that AI will have this fast changing impact on application development, this book opens the door for future programming paradigm. We are excited to practice the tips, tools and processes in the book.

I read another book about AI-assisted programming. It focused on Python and how to build a program. But it was too tedious.

As for Tom’s book, it has a much better approach. It focuses on the key areas for developers, without getting into the weeds with a certain language. The book is also chock full of great tips. Oh, and Tom’s writing style is breezy and fun. It didn’t take long to read this book.
